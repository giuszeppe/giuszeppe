Hi, I'm [Your Name]
About Me

I'm a passionate junior backend developer with a strong interest in functional programming. I love exploring new technologies and constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of software development. I'm here to share my journey and discoveries with you.
My Interests

    Functional Programming: I'm a big fan of functional programming paradigms, and I enjoy experimenting with Elixir. I believe that functional programming can lead to more robust and maintainable code.

    Backend Development: My primary focus is on backend development. I have experience with various programming languages and frameworks, including Python (Django), PHP (Laravel) and Elixir (Phoenix)

    Flutter: I've recently delved into mobile app development using Flutter. It's been an exciting journey, and I'm looking forward to sharing my experiences and learning with the Flutter community.

What You'll Find Here

    Code Snippets: I'll be sharing code snippets, examples, and projects related to functional programming, backend development, and Flutter. Feel free to use them in your projects or for learning purposes.

    IT-Notes: I'll be sharing every IT-related notes I take during my personal studies and during university lectures.

    Projects: I'll showcase personal projects and (I hope so) open-source contributions. You can expect a mix of practical applications and experimental projects that reflect my interests and skills.
